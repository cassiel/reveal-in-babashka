* =reveal.js-babashka=

[[https://revealjs.com/][Reveal.js]] slide rendering from [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][Hiccup]] (or, potentially, anything via [[https://github.com/retrogradeorbit/bootleg][Bootleg]]) implemented in [[https://babashka.org/][Babashka]].

** Usage

- Place a copy of =bb.edn= in the root directory of your presentation(s)
- Check the path in =bb.edn= to make sure =:paths= points to the =src= of this repository
- Check out a copy of [[https://github.com/cassiel/reveal.js][our reveal.js]] and (important) switch to the =ssi-version= branch
- =bb.edn= again: make sure =REVEAL_LOCATION= is set to this reveal.js checkout
- Do =bb presentation.clj= to do a one-shot processing of a presentation
- Update the arguments to =watch-all= and do a =bb watch= to start a watcher on several source files (note: we don't yet support watching of directories, or any other files other than the presentation file itself, so if they change, restart the script)
